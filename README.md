Points taken care of:
1. The user name field only accept an email format and the validation is done through Javascript.
2. The password field is a masked field i.e. it does not reveals what the user is entering.
3. The password field does not accepts any special character other than '@' and only gets accepted when it contains an uppercase letter and a number.
4. Whenever the password 'SmartServTest@123' is enetered redirects the user to the dashboard page looking like:

5. Clicking on the 'Forgot your password' link sends the user to send an email to 'support@smartserv.io' for resetting the password. Looking like:

Whenever any incorrect email is entered, such an alert is shown

Email is only accepted if it is in the valid format i.e. it must contain one '@' and one '.' indicating an email being valid.

Whenever any incorrect password is entered, such an alert is shown

In the end after entering the desired password user is able to see the metrics page.
